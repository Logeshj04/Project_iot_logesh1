## Features

- Real-time traffic data collection using IoT sensors.
- A web-based transit information platform for data visualization.
- Python scripts for data integration and analysis.
- Customizable and scalable architecture.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- IoT devices/sensors (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino)
- Web server for the transit information platform (e.g., Flask, Django)
- Database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Mobile app development tools (e.g., React Native)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https:
2.Set up the IoT sensors:
 
   Follow the instructions provided in the iot-sensors directory to set up your IoT devices for data collection.
3.Set up the transit information platform:
   
   Follow the instructions provided in the transit-platform directory to deploy the web-based platform.
4.Install Python dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5.Configure your database settings in config.py (if applicable).
6.Start the Python integration script:
    python data_integration.py
7.Develop and run the mobile app:
    Follow the instructions in the mobile-app directory to develop and run the mobile app for user access.
##Usage
 Visit the web-based transit information platform to visualize traffic data and gain insights.
 Modify the Python scripts in the scripts directory to customize data integration and analysis according to your needs.
##Raspberry Pi Data Transmission Example
Below is an example output of Raspberry Pi data transmission:
$ python data_integration.py

[INFO] Sensor 1: Traffic Flow - 25 vehicles/minute
[INFO] Sensor 2: Average Speed - 40 km/h
[INFO] Sensor 3: Weather Conditions - Clear sky
[INFO] Data transmitted successfully to the platform.
